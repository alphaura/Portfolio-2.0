                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p> As I progressed on the <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> course, I worked on creating a simple 1 way BlackJack game along with the educator, however,
                it was too simple for my liking, so I wanted to challenge myself and made it a project. The idea of the project is to create a better real-life or online blackjack game against
                the dealer with proper triggers following the rules of the game.</p>
           </div>

           <!-- Design Section -->

           <div class="design">
               <h3>The Design</h3>

               <p>The design on Figma, is somewhat unrecognisable from the final design you see in the live demo, that is because as I was coding the project, ideas to make the game more relevant
                to a real-life game were popping up, but the context still remains the same. I turned the design of the game to a more minimal look, just how I like it, as it keeps it clean and more
                focused on the game execution.</p>

               <p>The game predominantly has 6 features, 5 of them being buttons and 1 of them being a dynamic message. I have also added a toggle instruction box explaining how the game works.
                Game features are as follow;
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start Game:</strong> Randomly generates first card for the dealer and first two cards for the player</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Over?:</strong> Resets the game when the game has ended, prompting you to go again</li>
                    <li><strong>White message box:</strong> Text dynamically changes depending on the state of the game</li>
                    <li><strong>Hit Me!:</strong> Randomly generates a new card for the player</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay:</strong> Randomly generates a new card for the dealer</li>
                    <li><strong>End Game:</strong> Ends the game when neither side has reached BlackJack or busted</li>
                </ul>
               </p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>The challenge? The biggest challenge was mostly making it the gameplay work as I imagined it, which I have managed. It was no easy task, but with research and perseverance,
                    I managed to make it work. I do still have one issue which I haven't yet managed to fix even though I've went through the JavaScript code many times, and also passed it to chatGPT
                    yet, neither that could fix it. 
                    
                <p>The gameplay gets stuck after a few games, which I'm still working on getting it fixed. If any help can be provided to understand why this is happening,
                    that would be amazing.</p>
